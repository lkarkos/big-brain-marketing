        <p>I'm constantly writing little exerpts about this-and-that, but the most challenging prompts are "tell us a little bit about yourself" - it's like my brain does a full memory wipe.  You'll be lucky if I can confidently tell you my middle name under that pressure.</p>
        <p>We've made it to 2021, many of us fully vaccinated and enjoying that 5G and the effects of gene mutation slowly taking us to the next human evolution.</p>
        <p>One of my most favorite mutations has to be the efforts I've taken on myself.  Through self-inspired studies as well as hard earned hours through NEW Apprenticeship, my noggin' is full of so much more than we started with at the end of 2020.</p>
        <p>That's where this nifty little site comes into play!  I want to show off some of the great work that has happened here with my MA3-Tex cohort of absolutely marvelous super humans.</p>
